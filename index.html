              <p>“I was looking for a 90 minute deep tissue massage to help relieve chronic pain, especially in my neck. I have had a multilevel cervical fusion, but still have tightness and pain in the surrounding muscles. It takes quite awhile for my muscles to slowly relax during a massage. Emma focused on those areas until I could finally feel the muscles give way---such an &quot;Ahhhh&quot; feeling! I like deep massages and Emma didn&#x27;t disappoint. I highly recommend her for whatever your massage needs. I will be returning on a fairly regular basis.”</p>
