<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>Your therapist will arrive 10-15 minutes prior to your scheduled session to conduct your intake and set up the massage table with fresh 
        sanitized linens. You will need a 7' by 10' clear space for the table and room for the therapist to move around it. Please make sure any excitable 
        pets are taken care of. While we love your furry companions they are not licensed for tandem massage or impromptu table leg construction.
        Therapists need access to a place to wash their hands and step out of the room while you get comfortable on the table under the top 
        sheet and comforter. Top sheets are always required in accordance with our professional code of conduct and licensing standards. 
        You will be professionally draped at all times. If you have any question or would like the therapist to adjust 
        the pressure at any time please speak up and let them know. Please see our Policy and Terms of Service prior to booking.

<h2>Skills and Knowledge</h2>
<p>CLMM therapists are highly trained professionals with a decade of experience in medical and sports massage, pain management, and a 
        variety of massage techniques. Each therapist is licensed, insured, and participates in continuing education to keep their skill 
        sharp and their knowledge of scientifically backed specialty skills up to date. Each therapist will design a session based on your 
        needs and their skills, if you have a specific request please ask while booking so the right therapist can be matched with you. 
        Some of the techniques therapists may work into your session include:</p>

<li>Cupping, Hot Stones, Warm Towels</li>
<li>Neuromuscular and Sports Massage including stretching</li>
<li>Myofascial Release</li>

</ul>
<p>Massage therapists operate within a scope of practice as defined by the state's Massage Licensure and Practice Act. We are not 
        permitted to render a medical diagnosis, psychiatric therapy, or prescribe medications. In the event a therapist suspects this 
        may be necessary they will refer you to a licensed provider.
      </p>
<h2>Post Massage Care</h2>
<p>You may be achy or light headed after a massage especially if it has been an extended time between sessions. This is common and normal. 
        Massage puts strain on the musculature similar to a light work out and treating your body with care after a session can help you get 
        the most out of your massage. Staying hydrated and paying attention to your posture and tension can help with lasting effects of massage.
        If you are sore or uncomfortable after a session the use of heat and gentle stretching can help your body recover. If this is a post-injury
         massage ice can also be helpful. Both should be used in moderation.
