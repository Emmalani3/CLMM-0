    <div class="accordion" data-accordion>
      <button class="accordion__trigger button-18" aria-expanded="false">What areas do you serve?</button>
      <div class="accordion__panel" hidden>
        <p>Our primary service area is the Chicago Loop, Magnificent Mile, and nearby neighborhoods. 
          Our secondary service area is Evanston and Schaumburg. There is a $75 travel fee for secondary service areas.
          CLMM offers all inclusive In-Home or In-Hotel sessions where we provide all materials and equipment for sessions at your location.

      <button class="accordion__trigger button-18" aria-expanded="false">What should I prepare before the session?</button>
      <div class="accordion__panel" hidden>
        <p>Please clear a ~7’×10’ area, ensure parking access, and secure pets. We provide the table and sanitized linens and music. 
          You are welcome to prepare your own music and light you own candles in the space. We ask that you do not burn incense or smoke 
          during the session as many therapist may be allergic or sensative to particulates.</p>

      <button class="accordion__trigger button-18" aria-expanded="false">Are hot stones and cupping extra?</button>
      <div class="accordion__panel" hidden>
        <p>There is no extra charge for these additions. When appropriate, these tools are included at no extra charge. 
          This is a fantastic value added benefit of $70 
          Please inform your therapist if you would like them to be included. All cupping and hot stone use comes with 
          inherent risk and may leave minor marks that can last up to a week. Keep in mind that there are certain conditions 
          that may contraindicate the use of cupping or stones such as diabeties, high or low blood pressure, heart conditions, 
          blood clotting disorders, and the use of blood thinners. If you would like to know more about these topics 
          please contact us with your questions at ChicagoLuxuryMobileMassage@gmail.com</p>

      <button class="accordion__trigger button-18" aria-expanded="false">Do you include aroma therapy or essential oils?</button>
      <div class="accordion__panel" hidden>
        <p>No CLMM does not offer aroma therapy or essential oils through our practice. We are a scent neutral practice catering 
          to sensative individuals who may find these services overwhelming. Our therapists use unscented and hypoallergenic 
          products to make massage as accessable and confortable as possible for all. Some therapists also react to many of 
          these products with repeted exposure and this policy ensures that talented therapist can continue to work in healthy 
          environments without risking their health or safety</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion__trigger button-18" aria-expanded="false">Do you include CBD oils?</button>
      <div class="accordion__panel" hidden>
        <p>No CLMM does not offer CBD oils through our practice. Some states have complicated policies surounding CBD and many of the products are unregulated
           meaning we can not ensure consistent potency or effectivness. While CBD may be considered safe some therapists also react to 
           these products with repeted exposure and this policy ensures that talented therapist can continue to work in healthy 
           environments without risking their health or safety. There is more studying needed on the effects of CBD topicals and massage.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion__trigger button-18" aria-expanded="false">Can therapists use my prefered lotions instead of theirs?</button>
      <div class="accordion__panel" hidden>
        <p>No CLMM does not use clients provided lotions. This is because most lotions are not designed for massage therapy. tehy may get 
          tacky or cause skin irritation when applied with repeted pressure and friction. Many therapists practice with specific topical lotions 
          designed to hold up to the demands of massage and allow us to work smoothly without causig irritation. This also ensures 
          the therapist knows the ingredients and wont have an allergoc reaction to the lotion. This policy ensures that talented therapist 
          can continue to work in healthy environments without risking their health or safety.</p>

      <button class="accordion__trigger button-18" aria-expanded="false">How do memberships and packages work?</button>
      <div class="accordion__panel" hidden>
        <p>Packages include 10 sessions, at 10% off each session 
          Sessions can be shared at the same location with friends and family at no extra cost. 
          Packages are prepaid upon purchase and tracked by the therapist. We encourage customers to keep track of their used session.
          If you would like to know what sessions you have available you can ask for an update on your package at any time. 
          Packages include a table to keep in your home for the duration of the package. At the end of your package (10 massages) the table is yours to keep. 
          If you do not want to keep the table you can inform your therapist and return the table to CLMM. If you receive fewer than 10 massages, 
          the table remains property of CLMM and returns to the business at the end of the package.
          CLMM offers sheet service so a therapist brings clean sanitized sheets to each session and takes the laundry with them, no extra laundry for you.
          Packages may be purchased using Bitcoin!
        </p>
        <p><strong>How to sign up:</strong> Packages can be purchased in advance upon booking online. If you receive a massage and would like to start a package your therapist 
            can process your package request before rebooking you and apply your package to the next appointment. As sessions are prepaid we 
            can not retroactively activate a package. Please see the  Package page for additional terms and conditions.
        </p>

        <p>Memberships receive all the benefits of packages but are billed monthly
          Members are elligable for automated recurring booking and priority scheduling.
          Memberships are not currently eligable for Bitcoin Purchase
        </p>
        <p><strong>How to sign up:</strong> At your next appointment inform your therapist you would like to be a Gold Member and we will get you set up with 
            a membership agreement to read and sign. We will set up a card on file for your convenience. The membership will charge your first month upon activation 
            and reoccour on the date it was initiated. Your Massage for the month will be availabe the day after your renewal date each month.

      <button class="accordion__trigger button-18" aria-expanded="false">What is your cancellation policy?</button>
      <div class="accordion__panel" hidden>
        <p>Please provide at least 48 hours’ notice to reschedule or cancel. Late cancellations (wihtin the 48hrs) incur a 50% session fee. 
          Same day cancellations (within 24hrs) or no-shows will incur a 100% session fee. Mobile massage requires therapists to travel 
          between many locations and carefully calculate their time so they are not late for sessions this means sessions can not be 
          rebooked easily or taken by others at further locations without notice. This means a therapist is without work and a client 
          may not be able to book that session. Therapist still get paid for missed sessions which is why sessions are non refundable 
          and our cancelation policy is strict.</p>
        <p>If you are showing symptoms of contageous disease, experiencing fever, vomiting, or flu like symptoms please inform your therapist 
          that you need to reschedule immediately. A therapist may deny a massage if they suspect a client is in ill health and concealing a contageous 
          condition or illness. Massage is contraindicated for those experinecing illness, this is for your safety and continued health as well as the therapists. 
          In the event of a medical emergency seek professonal guidance and inform the therapist at your earliest conveninence if rescheduling is necessary.
        </p>
        <p>While we understand unforseen events may happen we ask that you do your best to respect therapists schedules and we will do everything
           to treat your time fairly in return. Thank you for being understanding.</p>
