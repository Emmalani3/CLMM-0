    <h2>Gift Card Terms of Service</h2>
    <li>Gift Cards are non refundable</li>
    <li>Gift cards have an expiration date of 1 year from purchase. This means that all cards revert to their cash value on this date. 
      In the event that prices have changed in that period of time, the card will no longer be worth the session length (1hr, 90min, 2hr) but 
      the cash cost. This may mean there is an additional fee for sessions to cover the differenc after this date.</li>
    <li>Gift Cards are fully transferable between individuals. Please ensure that the location of the recipient is within the service area.</li>
    <li>Clients are responsible for keeping track of their gift card and supplying the gift card code upon use. If proof of a gift card such 
      as the physical card, email, or GC-code is not present the gift card may not be redemed to cover a session.</li>
    <li>In the event that a client misses a sessions or there is a cancellation fee a gift card may be used to cover the cost of the session. 
      Any gift cards on file will automatically apply to the fee unless otherwise requested.</li>
    <li>Gift card recipients may still be required to place a card on file to book. If a gift card is viable the card on file will not get 
      charged for the session. This is a technical issue with booking software that can not be adjusted on a per client basis. Thank you 
      for understanding.</li>
    <li>In the event a gift card is lost or stolen please contact the business immediately. There is no guarentee this gift card can be 
      recovered but we may be able to search our records to match a proof of purchase with a replacement card.</li>
    <li>Please ensure you are purchasing certificates for the correct travel area. There may be a travel fee associated with secondary and out of service areas.</li>
