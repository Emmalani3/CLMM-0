<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Notice:</strong> Please provide at least 48 hours’ notice to reschedule or cancel without a fee.</li>
<li><strong>Late Cancel/No-Show:</strong> Late cancellations (wihtin the 48hrs) incur a 50% session fee. 
          Same day cancellations (within 24hrs) or no-shows will incur a 100% session fee. Please undestand that when you cancle or miss your 
          appointment  without providing notice we are ofen unable to fill the appointment time. This is an incneninence to your therapist 
          and also means our other clients miss the chance to receive services they need.</li>
<li><strong>Late Arrival:</strong> Please be available to allow your therapist in 10-15 minutes early. Ensure they have advanced 
          knowledge of any lobby or gated community entrances and codes so they are not delayed. Sessions will end at the scheduled time to respect 
          subsequent appointments. Therapists will do everything they can to arrive and start sessions on time. Please be patient and 
          understanding in extreme circumstances as Chicago is prone to unusual traffic events that your therapist cant control and 
          may be unpredictable. In the event a therapist is delayed they will contact you in advance. In the event a therapist is 
          late they will add the time to the end of the session if they are able to accomodate the time. If the session is shortened 
          they may alternately offer an extension of equal time for the next session.</li>
<li><strong>Illness:</strong> If you are showing symptoms of contageous disease, experiencing fever, vomiting, or flu like symptoms 
          within 24 hrs of your appointment please inform your therapist that you need to reschedule immediately. A therapist may deny 
          a massage if they suspect a client is in ill health and concealing a contageous condition or illness. Massage is contraindicated 
          for those experinecing illness, this is for your safety and continued health as well as the therapists. In the event of a 
          medical emergency seek professonal guidance and inform the therapist at your earliest conveninence if rescheduling is necessary. 
          Late cancellations due to medical emergency usually will not result in fees but this is determined on a case-by-case basis.
        </li>
<li><strong>Substitutes and Waitlist:</strong> In the event you can not make an appointment within the cancellation period you may 
          select a friend or family member at the same location to receive the session in your place at no additional cost to avoid canceling. 
          Please inform your therapist of any changes of recipient. When late cancellations occour we will activate our waitlist and if the 
          appontment is rebooked the fee may be waived. This is at the discretion of the business.</li>

          We will give you as much notice as possible and get you the soonest alternate date avaiable.</li>
<li><strong>Unforseen Events:</strong> While we understand unforseen events may happen we ask that you do your best to respect 
          therapists schedules and we will do everything to treat your time fairly in return. Mobile 
          massage requires therapists to travel between many locations and carefully calculate their time; this means sessions can not be 
          rebooked easily or taken by others at further locations without notice. Therapist still get paid for missed sessions outside of 
          thier control which is why sessions are non-refundable and our cancelation policy is strict. Thank you for being understanding.</li>
