<h2>Appointment Policy Overview</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Booking:</strong> Appointments are booked through our online booking website and prepaid. 
          We do not have the ability to accommodate same day appointments and require a minimum of 24 hour notice for appointments.</li>
<li><strong>Arrival:</strong> Please ensure timely building access and a clear space (~7’×10’) for setup.</li>
<li><strong>Parking:</strong>  Please inform your therapist of available parking near the address of your booked appointment. 
          If your building provides guest parking or parking passes include these instructions in your booking intake. If only paid 
          public parking is available or is required, fees exceeding $20 may be added to the session total. Therapists will not 
          park in fire lanes, emergency access lanes, and do not drive work trucks that can illegally park on sidewalks. Keep in 
          mind therapists are carrying 40+ pounds of bulky equipment and require close access for their vehicles to load their table in and out.</li>
<li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Clean linens are used for each client. Therapists will bring clean linens for each session and take 
          them back to be sanitized properly. All equipment is disinfected between sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Health:</strong> If you are unwell, experience flu like symptoms, or have a contagious condition, 
          please contact your therapist as soon as possible to reschedule.</li>
<li><strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> Both parties are expected to treat each other with respect and professionalism. 
          Inappropriate behavior will result in the termination of a session.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Cancellation &amp; Rescheduling</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Notice:</strong> Please provide at least 48 hours’ notice to reschedule or cancel without a fee.</li>
<li><strong>Late Cancel/No-Show:</strong> Late cancellations (within the 48hrs) incur a 50% session fee. 
          Same day cancellations (within 24hrs) or no-shows will incur a 100% session fee. Please understand that when you cancel or miss your 
          appointment  without providing notice we are often unable to fill the appointment time. This is an inconvenience to your therapist 
          and also means our other clients miss the chance to receive services they need.</li>
<li><strong>Late Arrival:</strong> Please be available to allow your therapist in 10-15 minutes early. Ensure they have advanced 
          knowledge of any lobby or gated community entrances and codes so they are not delayed. Sessions will end at the scheduled time to respect 
          subsequent appointments. Therapists will do everything they can to arrive and start sessions on time. Please be patient and 
          understanding in extreme circumstances as Chicago is prone to unusual traffic events that your therapist cant control and 
          may be unpredictable. In the event a therapist is delayed they will contact you in advance. In the event a therapist is 
          late they will add the time to the end of the session if they are able to accommodate the time. If the session is shortened 
          they may alternately offer an extension of equal time for the next session.</li>
<li><strong>Illness:</strong> If you are showing symptoms of contagious disease, experiencing fever, vomiting, or flu like symptoms 
          within 24 hrs of your appointment please inform your therapist that you need to reschedule immediately. A therapist may deny 
          a massage if they suspect a client is in ill health and concealing a contagious condition or illness. Massage is contraindicated 
          for those experiencing illness, this is for your safety and continued health as well as the therapists. In the event of a 
          medical emergency seek professinal guidance and inform the therapist at your earliest convenience if rescheduling is necessary. 
          Late cancellations due to medical emergencies usually will not result in fees but this is determined on a case-by-case basis.
        </li>
<li><strong>Substitutes and Waitlist:</strong> In the event you can not make an appointment within the cancellation period you may 
          select a friend or family member at the same location to receive the session in your place at no additional cost to avoid canceling. 
          Please inform your therapist of any changes of recipient. When late cancellations occur we will activate our waitlist and if the 
          appointment is rebooked the fee may be waived. This is at the discretion of the business.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme Weather:</strong> In the event of extreme weather or dangerous driving conditions your session may be rescheduled. 
          We will give you as much notice as possible and get you the soonest alternate date available.</li>
<li><strong>Unforseen Events:</strong> While we understand unforseen events may happen we ask that you do your best to respect 
          therapists schedules and we will do everything to treat your time fairly in return. Mobile 
          massage requires therapists to travel between many locations and carefully calculate their time; this means sessions can not be 
          rebooked easily or taken by others at further locations without notice. Therapist still get paid for missed sessions outside of 
          their control which is why sessions are non-refundable and our cancellation policy is strict. Thank you for being understanding.</li>

<h2>Professional Code of Conduct</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Professionalism:</strong>  Clients and therapists are expected to treat each other with mutual respect and professionalism 
          at all times. Therapists are expected to arrive on time with a professional demeanor in clean uniforms. They will use appropriate 
          skills, tools, and clean linens with each client. Therapists should not smell of smoke or other strong scents. We ask that clients 
          ensure spaces that therapists are working in are clean and free of smoke and other substances.
        </li>
<li><strong>Solicitation:</strong> There is absolutely no sexual component to professional massage whatsoever. Any insinuation, 
          joke, gesture, conversation, or request otherwise will result in the termination of services without a refund. 
          The choice to end a session for misconduct is at the sole discretion of the individual. Solicitation will be reported. Massage 
          therapists are licensed professional health care providers and deserve respect. Treat your therapist with respect and dignity and you will be treated the same in return.
