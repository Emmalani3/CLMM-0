<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<section class="section">
<h2>Packages Terms of Service</h2>
<li>Packages are non refundable</li>
<li>Packages have an expiration date of 1 year from purchase. This means that all packages revert to their cash value on this date. 
        In the event that prices have changed in that period of time, the package will no longer be worth the session length (1hr, 90min, 2hr) but 
        the cash cost. This may mean the remaining package can be treated like a cash certificate or there may be an additional fee for remaining 
        sessions to cover the difference after this date.</li>
<li>Packages are transferable between individuals as gift cards. If you are gifting a full package to an individual please ensure that 
        the location of the recipient is within the service area. When purchasing the package include the address of the recipient.</li>
<li>Packages as gift cards are written as a single card by default if you would like the sessions written on individual cards please 
        reach out the business with this request</li>
<li>Packages can be shared with friends and family at the same location and the primary package recipient at no additional cost. 
        Please inform your therapist if there will be a different recipient receiving the massage.</li>
<li>Packages are prepaid upon purchase and tracked by the therapist. We encourage customers to keep track of their used session.
          If you would like to know what sessions you have available you can ask for an update on your package at any time.</li>
<li>If proof of a gifted package such as the physical card, email, or PC-code is not present the package may not be redeemed to cover a session.</li>
<li>In the event that a client misses a session or there is a cancellation fee a package session may be used to cover the cost of the session. 
        Any package on file will automatically apply to the fee unless otherwise requested.</li>
<li>Package recipients may still be required to place a card on file to book. If a package is viable the card on file will not get 
        charged for the session. This is a technical issue with booking software that can not be adjusted on a per client basis. Thank you 
        for understanding.</li>
<li>In the event a package gift card is lost or stolen please contact the business immediately. There is no guarantee this gift card can be 
        recovered but we may be able to search our records to match a proof of purchase with a replacement.</li>
<li>Each package comes with a table to keep at the recipients address. This table access will make it easier for therapists to 
        accommodate your services. This table is yours to keep after 10 sessions or can be returned to the therapist. If you 
        already own a table and do not need one please inform the business upon purchase.</li>
<li>Please ensure you are purchasing certificates for the correct travel area. There may be a travel fee associated with secondary and out of service areas.</li>

        Any credits on file will automatically apply to the fee unless otherwise requested.</li>
<li>Members accounts have a card on file for the membership which will allow seamless booking.</li>
<li>Each Membership comes with a table to keep at the recipients address. This table access will make it easier for therapists to 
        accomodate your services. This tabel is yours to keep after 10 sessions or can be returned to the therapist. If you 
        already own a table and do not need one please inform the business upon purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Cancellation: </strong>If you would like to cancel your membership at any time please inform the business in writing at

        is requested within 7 days of the renewal your upcoming monthly credit for the month will be processed as the last session
