    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Packages Terms of Service</h2>
      <li>Packages are non refundable</li>
      <li>Packages have an expiration date of 1 year from purchase. This means that all packages revert to their cash value on this date. 
        In the event that prices have changed in that period of time, the package will no longer be worth the session length (1hr, 90min, 2hr) but 
        the cash cost. This may mean the remaining package can be treated like a cash certificate or there may be an additional fee for remaining 
        sessions to cover the difference after this date.</li>
      <li>Packages are transferable between individuals as gifts cards. If you are gifting a full package to an individual please ensure that 
        the location of the recipient is within the service area.</li>
      <li>Packages as gift cards are written as a single card by default if you would like the sessions written on individual cards please 
        reach out the business with this request</li>
      <li>Packages can be shared with friends and family at the same location and the primary package recipient at no additional cost. 
        Please inform your therapist if there will be a different recipient receiving the massage.</li>
      <li>Packages are prepaid upon purchase and tracked by the therapist. We encourage customers to keep track of their used session.
          If you would like to know what sessions you have available you can ask for an update on your package at any time.</li>
      <li>If proof of a gifted package such as the physical card, email, or PC-code is not present the package may not be redemed to cover a session.</li>
      <li>In the event that a client misses a sessions or there is a cancellation fee a package session may be used to cover the cost of the session. 
        Any package on file will automatically apply to the fee unless otherwise requested.</li>
      <li>Package recipients may still be required to place a card on file to book. If a package is viable the card on file will not get 
        charged for the session. This is a technical issue with booking software that can not be adjusted on a per client basis. Thank you 
        for understanding.</li>
      <li>In the event a package gift card is lost or stolen please contact the business immediately. There is no guarentee this gift card can be 
        recovered but we may be able to search our records to match a proof of purchase with a replacement.</li>
